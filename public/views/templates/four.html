<p>Also known as the Queen of Air and Darkness, Mab is easily one of the most powerful beings currently encountered in the books. The daughter of Mother Winter and the mother of Maeve, Mab has demonstrated her immense power both by performing great feats of magic with little or no effort and in her ways of punishing those who have dishonored her.

    First introduced in Summer Knight, she reveals that she now 'owns' Harry's debt to the Winter Fae. When the Leanansidhe returned to the Winter Court with a powerful athame, Mab forced her to sell Harry's debt contract to her to keep the balance in the court. In Dead Beat Mab was shown to have the athame, which she now possesses because she locked the Leanansidhe away for a time until she could be shown to have thrown off the corruptive influence the tainted gift had had upon her.</p><p>  </p>
<p> Mab's terrifying political acumen and ruthlessly manipulative cunning are on full display in Skin Game. The entire novel is about her gaining revenge on Nicodemus for leaving Accords that she drafted. She forces Harry to work with his archenemy by artfully removing all his other options ahead of time; has Nicodemus come to her to gain Harry's services in paying off an old debt; and gives Nicodemus the very idea of breaking into the vault of Hades just so he will murder his own daughter to do so, whilst convincing Marcone to set up the Vault for Nicodemus to break into specifically to make the link into Hades' vault to enact his own vengeance for his torture at Nicodemus' hands...and Hades to go along with it by being Marcone's first depositor. Furthermore, the idea that Nicodemus' daughter would not be judged by Heaven and so be free of punishment is completely voided by the fact that Hades takes his role as judge of the dead very seriously, indeed. It should be noted, however, that Nicodemus merely told his daughter she would be safe from "the Enemy" if her soul were left in Hades' keeping, and did not explicitly reference the forces of Heaven, leaving his ultimate meaning somewhat uncertain.</p>
