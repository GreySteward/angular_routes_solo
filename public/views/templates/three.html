<p>Thomas Raith is a White Court vampire, and naturally possesses a perfect human physique, supernatural strength, speed, and healing ability; all drawn from the demonic hunger within them. By drawing power from their 'inner demon', White Court vampires can become enormously and selectively powerful and their ability to drain normal humans can be increased over time to the point where they can literally kill with a quick kiss (Thomas' father was infamous for his 'kiss of death'). A side effect noted throughout the series is that when White Court vampires do draw on their demon, their eyes start to glow and their skin will seem more pale. Overuse of their demon's abilities requires the demon to be fed, which can induce a ravenous hunger, during which the White Court vampire will lose all control. A White Court vampire that cannot feed their demon is scarcely much more than a human being</p>
