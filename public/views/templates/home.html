<p>Harry Blackthorne Copperfield Dresden is Chicago's first (and only) Wizard P.I. Harry is a wizard who works as a supernatural private investigator in Chicago, dealing with paranormal crimes and consulting for the Chicago Police Department. He is named after three different stage magicians â€” Harry Houdini, Harry Blackstone, Sr., and David Copperfield. This name was given to him by his father, Malcolm Dresden, a stage magician with no genuine magical affinity. Malcolm raised Harry while performing all across the country, until he died of a brain aneurysm when Harry was six years old. The novels are written from Harry's perspective, in the style of hardboiled detective fiction.

    Harry possesses significant magical strength in comparison to other wizards of his age, though he lacks the fine control and manipulation of magic displayed by some practitioners. He originally favors elemental fire and wind spells in battle, but in later books focuses more strongly on fire and kinetic force. He has also been known to use earth magic (It's My Birthday Too and Turn Coat), lightning (Small Favor and Turn Coat), and water (Turn Coat). In later novels, he comes to rely on ice and cold magic as well. He is also skilled with tracking spells, along with summoning and entrapment spells which allow him to consult with supernatural creatures, such as demons, faeries and various other types of magical entity.  </p>
